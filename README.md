# 🏝️ Day 3 - Treasure Island Adventure

## 📖 Project Overview
**Treasure Island Adventure** is an interactive, text-based Python game where the player makes choices to navigate through a mysterious island in search of hidden treasure. Each decision affects the outcome, leading to either victory or failure.

This project focuses on understanding decision-making in programs using conditional logic.

## 🧠 What I Learned
- **Conditional Statements:** Used `if`, `elif`, and `else` to control the flow of the game based on user choices.
- **Logic and Flow Control:** Designed multiple paths and endings depending on player decisions.
- **User Input Handling:** Collected and evaluated user input to guide the story progression.

## ⚙️ How It Works
1. The game presents a storyline and asks the player to make choices.
2. Each choice leads to a different scenario.
3. Based on the decisions, the player either:
   - Finds the treasure 🏆
   - Or meets an unfortunate ending 💀

## ✨ Code Highlights
- Use of nested `if` / `elif` / `else` statements
- Text-based interaction using `print()` and `input()`
- Simple game logic with multiple outcomes
