# Day 3 – Treasure Island Adventure 🏝️

Part of my **100 Days of Python Projects** challenge.  
This project recreates the classic Python Treasure Island game using a terminal-style web interface.

---

## 🚀 Project Overview
Treasure Island Adventure is an interactive, text-based game where the player makes choices to navigate through a mysterious island in search of hidden treasure.  
Each decision affects the outcome, leading to either victory or failure.

This project focuses on decision-making using conditional logic.

---

## 📚 What I Learned
- Using conditional logic to control program flow
- Designing multiple paths and outcomes based on user choices
- Translating Python `if / elif / else` logic into JavaScript
- Handling user input dynamically in a terminal-style UI
- Structuring branching game logic clearly

---

## 🛠 How It Works
1. The game presents a storyline and prompts the user for choices  
2. Each choice leads to a different scenario  
3. Based on decisions, the player either:
   - Finds the treasure 🏆  
   - Or reaches a game-over ending 💀  

---

## 💡 Code Highlights
- Use of nested conditional statements for branching paths
- Step-by-step user input handling
- Text-based storytelling with multiple endings
- Clear separation of game logic and UI

## 🧪 Example
      Welcome to Treasure Island.
      Your mission is to find the treasure.
      You're at a cross road. Where do you want to go? Left or Right?
      left
      You come to a lake. Swim or Wait?
      wait
      You arrive at the island unharmed. Choose a door: Red, Blue, or Yellow.
      yellow
      You found the treasure! You Win! 🎉
